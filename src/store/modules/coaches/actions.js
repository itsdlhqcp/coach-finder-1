// Actions: Mutations are synchronous. If you want to update state asynchronously, use actions. Components should trigger actions which in turn trigger mutations. It's considered a good practice in general to put actions between components and mutations, even though components could could commit mutations themselves and it wouldn't be a problem if you only had synchronous code, to ensure that you never accidentally put asynchronous code into a mutation
